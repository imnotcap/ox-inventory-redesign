## Casper's Redesign
!! NOT DONE W.I.P !!

This redesign is a work in progress, released so that people can continue working on it. I have added a custom shop system as prod, and a crafting system (work in progress).
Use common sense, and feel free to join my Discord so we can share ideas and create more things together.

Do not resell, I have chosen to make it available to everyone so you don't have to pay a lot for a redesign that doesn't even work.
Remember to build the inventory before use, otherwise it's just plug n' play. (few items have been added)
